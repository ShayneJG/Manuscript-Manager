# Manuscript-Manager

This is a complete re-write of a project that me (Shayne Geilman) and Emma Moore wrote some time ago. Our original app functions more or less as desired, but we learnt as we went, and the end result was very unreadable and unmaintainable. We have learnt so much since then, and it seemed only natural for us to come back at this and implement all the new things we've learnt, while also adding new features!

The current plan is Typescript, Chakra UI, Next.js, and Node/Express.js and Mongoose/MongoDB for the backend.

Authentication is handled by next-auth, and user data is managed by a mongoDB collection (at the moment, this is just payrate/email).
